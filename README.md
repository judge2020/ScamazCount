# ScamazCount

### Tracks Scamaz Points in the channel of AmazHS. This can be adapted to other channels by changing program.cs:130 and 136. The PHP page is the main display of points, so don't worry about the Console.writeline's or how it's called points.

## ToDo:

* Become mono compatible, will require changing the ini library :(
* Add subscriber check so subs receive 2 "points" instead of one. note: when this is done, the "time" counter does not increase
