# ScamazCount
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jnh7c7k72a75qxqp/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/judge2020/scamazcount/branch/master)


### Tracks Scamaz Points in the channel of AmazHS. This can be adapted to other channels by changing program.cs:130 and 136. The PHP page is the main display of points, so don't worry about the Console.writeline's or how it's called points.

## ToDo:

* Become mono compatible, will require changing the ini library :(
* Add subscriber check so subs receive 2 "points" instead of one. note: when this is done, the "time" counter does not increase
